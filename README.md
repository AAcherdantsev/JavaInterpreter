Java Interpreter in C++: Limited Implementation with Semantic Tree

Project Description:
In 2020, a limited interpreter for the Java programming language was developed using C++. 
This project was undertaken as part of studying various grammars and formal language theory. 
In addition to program interpretation, a semantic tree was added to visualize the program structure.

Key Features:

Program: The interpreter can analyze and execute code written in the Main class of the Java language.

Data Types: Supported data types include short, long, and boolean.

Operations: Basic arithmetic operations, comparison operations, and logical operations are implemented.

Operators: Assignment operators and the do-while loop are supported.

Operands and Constants: The interpreter works with simple variables and constants. Constants can be integers in decimal and hexadecimal numeral systems, as well as logical values.

Syntax Tree: A syntax tree has been added to visualize the program's structure. This allows for a better understanding of how program components interact with each other and how the program executes.

This project not only serves as a functional interpreter but also as a tool for visualizing program structure, making it a valuable resource for learning programming fundamentals and demonstrating principles of code compilation and interpretation.
